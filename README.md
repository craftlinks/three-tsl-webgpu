# Minimal Three.js + TypeScript + WebGPU Project Setup

This project is a minimal setup using the development branch of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) with TypeScript and WebGPU. It showcases a galaxy simulation adapted from [Bruno Simon's work](https://bruno-simon.com/).

## Features

- **Three.js (dev branch)**: Leveraging the latest features from the development branch of Three.js.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing and improved developer experience.
- **WebGPU**: Utilizes the modern GPU API for high-performance rendering.
- **Galaxy Simulation**: An interactive galaxy example adapted from [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/).
